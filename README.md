# ðŸ“± Old Phone Pad Coding Challenge

This project is a solution to the **Old Phone Pad** C# coding challenge. It simulates typing on a classic mobile phone keypad where each number key corresponds to one or more letters.

## âœ… Challenge Description

You're given a string of input characters that simulate keypresses on an old mobile phone keypad. Your task is to interpret the sequence and return the intended output text.

### Key Features:
- Each number key (2â€“9) represents a group of letters.
- Pressing a number multiple times cycles through its letters.
- A **pause** (represented by a space `' '`) separates sequences from the same key.
- A **backspace** is represented by `*`, which removes the last character typed.
- A **send** is represented by `#`, which terminates the input and signals the end.
